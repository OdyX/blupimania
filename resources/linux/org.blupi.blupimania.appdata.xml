	<description>
		<p>Blupi comes out of a hole holding on to a balloon. Unfortunately he let's it blow away.
			Blupi is lost, he turns to the left or the right and does various unpredictable things
			of his own. The object of the game is to help him find another balloon, so that he can
			move on to the next riddle. Blupimania offers the option of creating your own riddles in
			level 5.</p>
