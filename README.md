## Original versions (1997)

You can find "mostly" the original source code from previous versions (v1.7 and
v1.8, 1997) under the tags `v1.7.0` and `v1.8.0`. Note that both tags are
targetting the same commit. The reason is that the version 1.8 was done because
a bug was discovered on the cdroms (deployment problems only).
